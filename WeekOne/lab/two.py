# We would like to create a program to calculate the volume of a sphere given a certain radius

# A program to solve (x + y) * (x + y)

# How many liters of water fall on an acre of land given the number of cm of rain that fell*? For example, how many liters for 1 cm, 2 cm, etc.?
# * Cm of rain that fell means rain has accumulated to a depth of 1 cm over a certain area.
